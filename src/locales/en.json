	"main tagline": "Making an animation movie is more than an artistic challenge.",
	"main explaination one": "Managing a production well and having an efficient pipeline are two challenges animation studios face when they scale. At the beginning, with a good sense of organisation,  everything runs well. But when productions are bigger or when delays are shorter you can be quickly overwhelmed.Â Graphists lose time looking for the right files, validation tracking becomes harder and repetitive tasks without artistic values are flooding.",
	"main explaination two": "Then, comes an idea to gather a technical team to build your own tools. Unfortunately, getting organized to create a good software, is complicated and results are slow. Your business is to make beautiful movies, so creating a whole new software in a limited amount of time might not be what feels most natural to you.",
